# Mr.Unfortunate
a 2D adventure and puzzle game!

Unsuccessful in business and languid in daily life, Mr. Unfortunate decides to commit suicide. It seems that fate has a different thought from him. Would his plan work this time?

Mr. Unfortunate is a small 2D adventure game. In this game, you'll explore diverse scenes and interact with various objects using only the mouse. Whenever you get stuck in gameplay walkthrough, check the journal and follow the instructions.

This game was created originally for Geta Game Jam #4. That was the first time for me to attend a jam. I underestimated the difficulty of developing a game solely and I didn't complete it at the deadline. But every start deserves a good ending, so I continued and finished the game development the day after. Hope you enjoy it!
